# IoT-based Crop Recommendation and Fertilizer Prediction with Machine Learning

## Description:

This project leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection and fertilizer application. By analyzing real-time soil data (N, P, K, moisture, and temperature) and weather information, the system recommends suitable crops and predicts the optimal fertilizer quantity for the maintanence of the crop.
### This repo is the frontend of the project.

## Features:

### Real-time Soil Sensing: Integrates with IoT sensors to collect crucial soil parameters (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, moisture, and temperature) for accurate analysis.
### Weather Data Integration: Predicts weather data (e.g., temperature, rainfall) to account for its impact on crop growth and fertilizer requirements.
### Machine Learning-powered Crop Recommendation: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to analyze soil and weather data, recommending crops best suited for the specific conditions.
### Fertilizer Quantity Prediction: Predicts the optimal amount of fertilizer needed based on the chosen crop, soil analysis, and weather data, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
### User Interface (UI): Developed a user-friendly interface to visualize data, access recommendations, and manage sensor data.
